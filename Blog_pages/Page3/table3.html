                <p id="Intro">Modern-day web systems rely on user feedback (such as click activity or ratings) to build ML models to personalize recommendations. Such recommender systems form the core of several popular applications that recommend short videos (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube), timeline feeds (Twitter, Facebook), the next product to buy (Amazon, Ebay), etc.  </p>

                <p>Model retraining is the process of updating the data of any deployed model. The updated data is used to retrain the model and keep the model up to date. It ensures the accuracy rate and precision rate of the model are not compromised, and quality service is ensured. However, model retraining doesn't change the model's algorithm; it simply means updating the model's dataset to get accurate results even after a long time.

                <p id="fststep"><b>1. Selection bias:</b> It arises due to the user’s self-selection behavior. For example, a user might rate a movie they like but rarely rate a movie they dislike. Training on such a dataset is challenging since high ratings account for the majority of observed ratings. These ratings are not a representative sample of all ratings; that is, the rating data is often missing not at random, thus incorporating a selection bias. The following figure from a rating survey highlights this issue, where users tend to only rate items that they like.

                <p>The above biases are due to user behaviors, but there are biases present in the training data itself, such as the <b>popularity bias</b>, where some items are more popular than others and hence generate more feedback from users, eventually making recommendations biased towards them. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another bias generally seen in training data is <b>Unfairness</b>, which is due to the recommender system unfairly discriminating against certain groups of individuals, such as on the basis of gender, race, age, wealth, education level, etc. For example, in the context of job recommendation, it has been found that women see fewer advertisements about high-paying jobs due to gender imbalance in training data. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, due to the <b>Feedback Loop</b> in recommender systems, these biases only intensify over time, resulting in a “the rich get richer” effect. This is because a bias in data results in a bias in recommendations, which in turn impacts the exposure and selection of users, causing further biases in the data.

                    Feedback loops are detected by measuring the diversity of popularity of items in the system. The popularity of all items generally follows a long-tail distribution, where most of the items are not interacted with at all. In general, the more diversity of outputs of the recommender systems (aka the long-tail distribution has a greater entropy), the less the system suffers from degenerate feedback loops. On the other hand, low scores imply a homogeneous system that suffers from popularity bias.

                <p>Due to the above biases, the data observed by a recommendation system used to personalize users’ preferences might deviate from reflecting users’ true preferences. 
                    The ubiquity of such systems in modern web companies has resulted in a growing interest in ameliorating bias in recommender systems. The following methods have gained significant interest due to their effectiveness in reducing bias.

The propensity score models the probability of exposure to a specific item. These probabilities are then later used to reweigh the interactions while retraining. For example, if the probability of exposure to an item is high, it can be downweighed during training to reduce the effects of its exposure on the user.

The basic idea is to introduce an adversary whose aim is to confuse the recommender by giving a signal to recommend more niche items. Eventually, the adversary learns the implicit association between popular and niche items while the recommender captures niche items that correlate with the user’s history, resulting in more long-tail item recommendations.
